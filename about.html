            <h4>More About Our Group.</h4>
            <p>We are dedicated to make learning different aspects of robotics easy and fun. 
              Our main goal is to make robotics technology easily accessible so that more young
              minds aspire towards this field. We are developing our competence  in the area of Humanoid robotics
              movement and control, Compliant soft robotics for safe human-robot interaction and navigation of mobile 
              robots and drones.
              
              If you are interested in robotics and would like to pursue your research interest in this field but 
              demotivated by the fact that access to the robots is expensive and limited to few world class 
              laboratories and universities, then this is the place for you. Our effort is to provide a platform 
              where you can learn about advances in robotic technology. You can be the part of research projects 
              offered and supervised by the researchers around the world and even able to perform experiments on 
              simulators and robots to suport your research.
