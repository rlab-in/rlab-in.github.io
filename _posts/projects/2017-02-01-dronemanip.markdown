Drones are now everywhere and they are finding applications in every walk of our life whether it is photography, 
delivery, rescue and surveillance etc. A drone can be even more useful if it has an arm to manipulate something 
rather than just taking pictures.  We propose a project where we will work with a drone having two degrees of 
freedom manipulator arm at the base.

The main objective is to design and model such system (combination of a drone and a robotic arm) and perform a 
task of pick and place through aerial rout. 
 
Students can join the project and discuss with the project owner about their responsibilities.
