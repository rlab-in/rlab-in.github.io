Industrial robotic arm is one of the classic platform to learn the basics of robotics.  
We propose to use such an arm wich has seven degrees of freedom.
 <!--more-->
The goal is to develop the entire model in the simulator. Using this model, We will cover the basics 
like kinematics and dynamics of robot manipulator. Using advanced algorithm for motion planning, 
applications will be develooped where the robot will paint some simple designs like circle or ellipse. 
Students can join the project and discuss with the project owner about their responsibilities.



Project Level: Undergraduate to Phd

Project scope:

* Study and develop a kinematic model for an industrial robotic  arm with several joints.
* Develop a URDF and 3D model and simulate the kinematics in Simulator (ROS and Gazebo)
* System modelling  for a standard robotic manipulator
* Design controller to move the arm.
* Learn motion planning technique to design the movement of the arm


Requirements:
Students from all level from undergraduate to Phd level can join this project

Recommended background: Electronics/Eectrical, computer Science, Mechanical, and similar
