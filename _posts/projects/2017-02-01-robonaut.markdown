Robonaut is a humanoid torso robot developed by NASA to assist astronauts at ISS (International Space Station). 
In this project, we will give the model of the robot and the goal is to develop application using this robot.
 <!--more-->
The main objective is to understand motion planning for humanoid robots. In this project, students are encouraged to 
develop a motion plan to execute a task of opening/closing a safety port at ISS. Extensive use of Moveit! 
and other tools will be introduced.
 
Students can join the project and discuss with the project owner about their responsibilities.
