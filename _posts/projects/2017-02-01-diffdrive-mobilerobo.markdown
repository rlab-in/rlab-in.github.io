Autonomous navigation is one of the most interesting research area in the present time with the boom 
in the market of autonomous vehicle and autopilot. Here, we propose to start learning the algorithms 
behind these autopilots by applying on a simple differential drive mobile robot platform which is equipped 
with sensor like laser scanner for localization.

The goal is to first develop the entire model of the robot including the sensor in the simulator. Using this model, 
We will cover the basics of path planning, obstacle avoidance and sensor fusion algorithms. The robot is supposed 
to travel and map an unknown environment with static obstacles. Students can join the project and discuss with the project owner about their responsibilities.



Project Level: Undergraduate to Phd

Project scope:

* Study and develop a kinematic model for a differential drive mobile robot
* Develop a URDF and 3D model and simulate the kinematics in Simulator (ROS and Gazebo)
* Learn and implement advance algorithm like A* and SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping)
* Special consideration on the implementation of SLAM which is one of the most important algorithm 
  in autonomous navigation.


Requirements:
Students from all level from undergraduate to Phd level can join this project

Recommended background: Electronics/Eectrical, computer Science, Mechanical, and similar
