                <h4>Vision</h4>
                <p>If you are interested in robotics or humanoid robotics in particular and would like
                  to pursue your research interest in this field but demotivated by the fact that access
                  to the robots is expensive and limited to few world class laboratories and univesities,
                  then this is the place for you. Our effort is to provide a platform where you can learn
                  about advances in robotic technology. You can be the part of research projects offered
                  and supervised by the researchers around the world and even able to perform experiments
                  on simulators and robots to suport your research.</p>

                <h4>Projects</h4>
                <p>Offered projects are here! These research projects are volunteerily proposed by  Phd
                  candidates and several other researchers from various laboratories and universities in
                  their personal capacities. Please browse the projects and be the part of one or more
                  projects that suit your research interest.</p>

                <h4>Courses</h4>
                <p>Fundamental knowledge of mathematics, kinematics, dynamics and control is neccessary to
                  conduct research in robotics. Also the computer programming skills, basic electronics and
                  embedded system are nontheless important. Here not  only we provide vast resources for self
                  learning but also offer short courses, some of them are supervised, which will provide you
                  indepth understanding of such concepts.</p>
